# Neuradeep ðŸŒ¾ - Smart Agriculture Assistant Bot

Neuradeep is a Telegram-based chatbot designed to answer agriculture-related queries, along with general questions. It uses a custom dataset that Iâ€™ve prepared, containing accurate and up-to-date information specific to my region.

Note: The dataset is currently very small, but Iâ€™m adding more data regularly to improve its accuracy and performance.

## New Feature: Context-Aware Conversations

### What's New?
Weâ€™ve recently added a **context awareness** feature to Neuradeep! Now, the bot can remember up to the last **6 user messages** during a conversation. This helps the bot understand the conversation flow better and respond in a more natural and relevant way.

### How it works:
- **Message History**: The bot stores the last 6 messages from each user.
- **Contextual Responses**: The bot uses this stored context along with its database to generate more accurate, context-aware responses.

Previously, Neuradeep would only use the current user query and database context for answering questions. Now, with context-awareness, the bot can take into account previous user inputs to keep the conversation smooth and coherent.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- MiniLM (from HuggingFace Transformers)
- ChromaDB (Vector Database)
- Phi-2 (Small language model)
- Telegram Bot API

## How It Works

Neuradeep is built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1. **Document Ingestion**  
   The documents are chunked and embedded using MiniLM (a small transformer-based model) and stored in ChromaDB.

2. **Querying**  
   When a user asks a question, itâ€™s embedded and compared with existing chunks using ChromaDB to retrieve the most relevant context.

3. **Answer Generation**  
   The retrieved context and the userâ€™s question are sent to Phi-2, a lightweight LLM, which then generates a relevant and context-aware response.

4. **Context Awareness**  
   The bot now tracks the last 6 user messages, enabling it to provide more personalized and fluid conversations based on previous exchanges.

## NOTE:
This bot is not hosted publicly 24/7. If you try interacting with it on Telegram and it doesnâ€™t respond, it's likely because the server is not currently running. To use the bot yourself, youâ€™ll need to clone this repo and run it locally or deploy it to a hosting platform.
